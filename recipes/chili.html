            <div class="steps-header">Steps</div>
            <div class="steps"> 
                <b class="step">1. Prepare the vegetables.</b>               
                    Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square.
                    Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.
                    Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop.
                    Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.

                <b class="step">2. Start cooking.</b>            
                    Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat.
                    Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for <i>1-2 minutes</i> until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).

                <b class="step">3. Add the onion.</b>             
                    Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about <i>5 minutes</i>, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.
                
                <b class="step">4. Add the garlic and other veggies.</b>            
                    Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.

                <b class="step">5. Stir.</b>     
                    Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another <i>5 minutes</i>, stirring occasionally.
                
                <b class="step">6. Cook the minced beef.</b>    
                    Brown 500g lean minced beef.
                    Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula.
                    The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.

                <b class="step">7. Continue stirring.</b>   
                    Keep stirring and prodding for at least <i>5 minutes</i>, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits.
                    Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.

                <b class="step">8. Make the sauce. </b>            
                    Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. 
                    Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.

                <b class="step">9. Add the chopped tomatoes.</b>     
                    Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes.
                    Tip in <span>&#189;</span> tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper.
                    Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato pur<span>&#233;</span>e and stir the sauce well.

                <b class="step">10. Simmer gently.</b> 
                    Bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan.
                    Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for <i>20 minutes</i>.

                <b class="step">11. Check occasionally.</b>              
                    Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn’t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn’t drying out.
                    If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough.
                    After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.

                <b class="step">12. Prepare to add the kidney beans.</b>
               
                    Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot.
                    Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another <i>10 minutes</i>, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.

                <b class="step">13. Taste test.</b>
               
                    Taste a bit of the chilli and season.
                    It will probably take a lot more seasoning than you think.

                <b class="step">14. Replace the lid.</b>
               
                    Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for <i>10 minutes</i> before serving
                    This is really important as it allows the flavours to mingle

                <b class="step">15. Serve the food</b>         
                    Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice
